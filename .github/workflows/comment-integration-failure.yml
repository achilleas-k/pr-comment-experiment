# This workflow runs when the Integration workflow reports a failure through
# an artifact. The Integration workflow itself doesn't fail if the testing or
# linting fails, instead it reports a failure through a shared artifact that
# this workflow reads and reports on. The failure is communicated to the author
# and reviewers of a PR without causing a failed action to appear.
#
# This workflow is run on a workflow_run trigger to have access to secrets.
#
# TODO: Actually do what the comment says.

# Based on https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#using-data-from-the-triggering-workflow
